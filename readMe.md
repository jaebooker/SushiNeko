Sushi Neko Kitty eats way too much sushi, and gets fat.

To prepare for his next fight at the Cat Fight Club, he has decided to train by punching sushi... his favorite food.


Kitty gains strength and points from punching sushi, and loses strength and points if he encounters a chopstick, because he won't be able to resist eating the sushi and getting still fatter.


He also loses points by sitting around, lazing about on his fat kitty bum.


He starts out with 100 points, and needs to fill his strength bar to progress to the next level.


The levels are White, Green, Blue, Red, and Gold.


Help Sushi Neko Kitty win his next fight!
